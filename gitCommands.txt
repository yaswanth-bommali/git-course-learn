git --version = To get the version of git installed
----- To configure username and email/password 
git config user.name "username"
git config user.password "password"
git config user.email "email"
----- To create a repository in our local system
git init ( gives master )
git init -b main ( gives main )
-b = branch
----- To know the status of git
git status
----- To use the main branch ( not master )
Remove .git = rm -rf .git

----- To commit ( commit is similar to saving in Staging area )
git add filename ( with extension ) = To move to staging area
commit = git commit (generates message )
To insert = git commit -m "message"
----- To get all commits
git log
----- To skip Staging area and do a direct commit from Working Directory
git commit -a -m "message"
------ To get the changes happened in file 
Use diff command = git diff (In Working Directory)
git diff --staged ( In Staging Area )
------ To remove a file from git repository
( Say generally creds.txt and md-Markdown )
How to add all files to Staging area - git add .
Removing - git rm --cached filename
----- To get the entire repository into our system
git clone link
----- To create a main branch
git branch -M main
----- To move the data (push) and get the data (pull) from the remote repository
We should use either github/gitlab/bitbucket etc.
( Using Github here )
It's better to use SSH instead of HTTPS because in HTTPS we have to enter username and password again and again
To generate SSH key = ssh-keygen -o
Add the SSH generated in Github settings by generating SSH Keys
To connect SSH to our remote repository = git remote add origin git@github.com:yaswanth-bommali/git-course-learn.git
git-course-learn = New Repository created in github
git@github.com:yaswanth-bommali/git-course-learn.git = Link provided by Github ( differs for each and every account )
----- To push the code to remote repository
git push -u origin main
----- To see origin
git remote -v
------ Git Tag 
To add the version number to our files/applications 
To add tag = git tag -a tagnumber -m "Message"
-a = annotated
To get detailed information about tag = git show tagnumber
Push the tags also seperately
git push origin tagnumber
----- Git Branch
To Create = git checkout -b branchName (or) git switch -c branchName
To know how many branches = git branch
To switch between branches = git switch/checkout branchname
